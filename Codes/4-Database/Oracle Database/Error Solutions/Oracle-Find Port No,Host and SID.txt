//Follow the following directories(path) one by one to Find portno,host and SID and of Oracle Database 11g

1.	go to C Drive
2.	oraclexe
3.	app
4.	oracle
5.	product
6.	11.2.0(folder with the name of oracle version)
7.	server
8.	network
9.	ADMIN
10.	listner.ora (it is a file which contains the host and port no)
11. tnsnames.ora (it is a file which also contains host,port no as well as SID)

//The complete path is as follows

C -> oraclexe -> app -> oracle -> product -> 11.2.0 -> server -> network -> ADMIN -> listner.ora / tnsnames.ora (both files are located in the same directory we use tnsnames.ora because it contains all 3 required things but we can also use listner .ora but it contains only portno and host not SID.for SID we still require tnsnames.ora)
